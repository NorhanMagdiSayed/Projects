# Embedded Security System with UART Communication

This is a simulation of a microcontroller-based security system designed using two **ATmega32** microcontrollers. The system integrates a PIR sensor, keypad, LCD, LEDs, buzzer, 7-segment display, and DC motor to emulate a complete access control and intruder alert system. The project is developed and simulated using **Proteus Design Suite**, with all driver files written manually in C.

## System Overview

### Communication:
- **UART Serial Communication** is used between the two ATmega32 MCUs:
  - **Master MCU** handles keypad input.
  - **Slave MCU** controls the LCD, LEDs, motor, buzzer, and PIR sensor.

### Workflow:
1. **Motion Detection:**
   - When the PIR sensor detects motion (logic high), the LCD prompts the user to enter a password.

2. **Password Verification:**
   - If the entered password is correct:
     - LCD shows `Access Approved`
     - Green LEDs light up
     - DC motor activates (door opens)
   - If the password is incorrect:
     - LCD shows `Access Denied`
     - 7-segment display increments attempt count

3. **Intruder Alert:**
   - After 3 failed attempts:
     - LCD displays `There is an intruder!!`
     - Red LEDs turn on
     - Buzzer is activated
